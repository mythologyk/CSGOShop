CSGOShop

An Open-Source CS:GO Marketplace

###What is CSGOShop?

CSGOShop is a marketplace for Counter-Strike:Global Offensive founded by Matty.

###Why is this code Open-Source ?

Our servers were breached on the 4th of September, because of this and other things we decided to release it as an open-source platform instead.
